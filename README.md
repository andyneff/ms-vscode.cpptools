# C/C++ for Visual Studio Code

You can find more detailed information about C/C++ support on Visual Studio Code at our [documentation page](http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

This is the preview release for C/C++ support in Visual Studio Code. This extension adds code-editing and debugging support for your C/C++ code.
Debugging is currently tested and officially supported for Ubuntu 14.04, OS X, and Windows. We are working on supporting other Linux distributions.

VSCode 1.4.0 or above is required.

If you run into any problems, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues).

## Editing C/C++ Code
The extension adds following code-browsing features for C/C++
* Navigate to Symbol
* Go to Definition
* Go to Declaration

## Debugging C/C++ Code
The extension also introduces the ability to debug C/C++ code. The following debugging features are currently supported as a part of this extension.

* Breakpoints (function, conditional)
* Expression evaluation
* Call Stack
* Attach or Launch
* Stepping
* Watch
* Memory Dump debugging
* GDB, LLDB and MI commands, when using the `C++ (GDB/LLDB)` debugging environment

For help configuring the debugger see [Configuring launch.json for C/C++ debugging](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/blob/master/launch.md) on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools). 

## Debugging Platform Support

### Linux
Debugging is supported on Linux using GDB. The debugging components have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (x64). Other Linux distributions may work too, but have not been tested.

### OS X
Debugging is supported on OS X using LLDB and GDB.

#### Using LLDB on OS X 
For new users, debugging will default to LLDB using a copy of LLDB 3.8.0 that is automatically installed by the extension.

Existing GDB users on OS X will need to delete the existing `launch.json` inside their project folder and allow the extension to generate a new `launch.json`.

#### Using GDB on OS X
To use GDB on OS X, locate the `osx` section inside of the `C++ Launch` or `C++ Attach` sections in `launch.json` and change `MIMode` from `lldb` to `gdb`.

#### Manual Installation of GDB for OS X
1. Install homebrew by executing the following in Terminal:
    * `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
2. Install GDB by executing the following in Terminal. Note that the path to GDB will be `/usr/local/bin/gdb`:
    * `brew tap homebrew/dupes`
    * `brew install gdb`
3. Sign the GDB binary as described [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn/Codesigning-the-Debugger.html).

#### Known Issues for OS X
* When attaching to a process with GDB, the debuggee cannot be interrupted. Only breakpoints set while the debuggee is not running will be bound (e.g., before attaching or while the debuggee is in a stopped state). This is due to [a bug in GDB](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20035).
* Core dumps cannot be loaded when debugging with GDB, which [does not support the core dump format used in OS X](https://www.sourceware.org/ml/gdb/2014-01/msg00036.html).
* When attached to a process with GDB, break-all will kill the process.
* When debugging with LLDB, if the Terminal window is closed while in break mode, debugging does not stop. Debugging can be stopped by pressing the **_Stop_** button.

### Windows
Debugging is supported on Windows using the Visual Studio Windows Debugger and GDB.

#### Using the Visual Studio Windows Debugger
This extension will automatically install the C/C++ debugger that is bundled with Visual Studio. In order to use the Visual Studio Windows Debugger, select `C++ (Windows)` as the debugging environment.

This is the recommended option on Windows.

#### Using GDB on Windows
This extension also supports debugging with GDB from a Cygwin or MinGW installation. In order to use GDB, select `C++ (GDB/LLDB)` as the debugging environment.

#### Known Issues for Windows

Using GDB:
* GDB on Cygwin cannot open core dumps.
* GDB on Cygwin and MinGW cannot break a running process. In order to set breakpoints in run mode, or pause the debuggee, press Ctrl-C in the debuggee terminal. 
* User must manually set the path to GDB in `launch.json` if `gdb.exe` is not on the path. For example: `"miDebuggerPath":"c:\\mingw\\bin\\gdb.exe"` or `"miDebuggerPath":"c:\\cygwin64\\bin\\gdb.exe"`

### Known Issues for All Platforms

* There is no way to specify the source file mappings from the compiled locations to the current location. This prevents debugging an application in a different filesystem structure than where it was compiled.
