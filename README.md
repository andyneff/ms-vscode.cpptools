## Change History
### My modifications ###

I'm working on getting gdb working with the current plug in capabiliteis for gdbserver and dockers. This covers a number of scenarios

#### gdbserver used as normal ####

Is covered pretty well [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/265#issuecomment-250339508)

Launch configuration `"program": "${command.remoteCopyProgram}",` can optionally be used to copy the remote program locally for you
(Currently this is not cleaned up, leading to a lot of random files in your temp dir)

#### gdbserver used in --multi mode ####

Currently only works in a `launch` configuration (on Linux). Here's an example

1. Run `gdbserver 0.0.0.0:6666` (or what ever ip/port you want)
2. Create a `lanch.json` like this

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "C++ Launch",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "args": [],
            "stopAtEntry": true,
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "environment": [],
            "externalConsole": true,

            "miDebuggerServerAddress": "localhost:6666",
            "remoteProcessId": "${command.pickRemoteProcess}",
            "program": "${command.remoteCopyProgramMulti}",
            "miDebuggerPath": "${command.remoteGdbMulti}",

            "miDebuggerGdbCommands": ["directory /opt/projects/myproject/somedir/"],


            "linux": {
                "MIMode": "gdb"
            },
            "osx": {
                "MIMode": "lldb"
            },
            "windows": {
                "MIMode": "gdb"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Because this is a nasty hack, the order of the four lines in the center matter since each one uses the previous

I added:

- `"${command.pickRemoteProcess}"` - Which will allow you to pick a process that is running on  miDebuggerServerAddress just like `"${command.pickProcess}"`. Of course you could just type in the pid number manually
- `"${command.remoteCopyProgramMulti}"` - Which automatically copies the binary from the remote server so that symbols can be loaded. Of course you could just use your own copy
- `"${command.remoteGdbMulti}"` - This is the part that you need to make it work. It creates a temporary wrapper script to fix all the current issues getting `--multi` mode working
- Added `miDebuggerGdbCommands` - This allows you to specify an array of gdb command run on initilization. This is equivalent to .gdbinit [here](http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ), only I argue not having to make "yet another file" is better

It may be possible to get `command.remoteGdbMulti` working in windows, using batch, but I wasn't concerned with that. This is more of a proof of concept

##### How can all this become not neccesary? #####

1. Need a flag to switch mi command `-target-select remote`  to `-target-select extended-remote + -target-attach`
2. `miDebuggerGdbCommands` as an optional argument to add any command to gdb startup
3. A way to have the source program copied locally before attaching would be useful to make the entire debugging experience fluid
4. An offical version of `command.pickRemoteProcess`

#### gdb in a docker ####
